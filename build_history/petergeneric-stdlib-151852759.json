the refresh token to get an updated Authorisation Token when it expires\n - Client will automatically redirect to the OAuth provider on the first auth constraint requiring authentication\n\nServer:\n - Security enhancement to make sure that only registered endpoints can be used (previously allowed endpoints starting with one of the registered strings, however this can be an issue if the service
